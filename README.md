Protean 8x2 Serial Protocol for I/O control using RS485

# Protean 8x2 Serial Protocol (C/C++ Variant)

This is not a library, but the main code that runs on the Protean 8x2 to perform the basic I/O functions needed to use the board as intended. Currently, it has no redundancy, error checking, or hardware setup sequence for baud rate or address. Hopefully later though! :D

## Version – 1.1

## Suggested Boards
- Protean 8x2 V1+ (using the ATmega328P) [Kickstarter Preview] (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/939637926/1475517171?token=f2811508)

## Intended MCUs
- ATmega328P/B

## Serial Terminal Communication
The *.yat files and text files in Serial_Files are intended for use with the [YAT Terminal] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/y-a-terminal/).
